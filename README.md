### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rafael and spend most of my time working on server-side Swift and making iOS apps! I'm currently working on a Los Angeles based startup called [Ultraviral](https://github.com/rafaellevy/)

You can find more about me on [my website](https://www.rafaellevy.com) and I'm sporadically active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raflev/).
In addition, I created [Weather Pets](https://github.com/rafaellevy/weatherPets-ReadMe), an iOS app that lets children and their families experience the weather, air quality, and other important environmental factors in an easy-to-understand animated presentation. The app includes weather conditions and air quality index in real time, as well as the moon phases.

If you want to get in touch, you can send an email me at srlevy1@gmail.com
